  description: 'In the world Etheria lies the great city of Darkspire. The Darkspire
    Citadel is the largest fortress city on the planet and still remains to this
    day.   It all started when the first people immigrated over to where Darkspire
    is held. The area had rich soil and access to the ocean. The people were banished
    from the old capital Eldoria they were the first descendants of  Dygonmir the
    Immortal and were of pure blood, a power that was deemed too powerful.  '
