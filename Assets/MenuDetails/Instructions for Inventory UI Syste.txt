Instructions for Inventory UI System:

To make a new inventory item:

-create an item scriptable object
-assign values to the SO

	KEY:
all options:
	Assign Item = drag the scriptable object you just made here
	Item Type: 1 = weapons, 2 = anatomy, 3 = lore, 4 = quests (determines the menu tab it will go to)
	Item Name: how the item will be titled in the menus (make this the same as whatever you called the item SO)
	Description: the largest text block
	Id: ignore that lol
only for some:
	Subtitle: subtitle (will show up on the right and left menus for quests and lore)
	Icon: the image that will represent it on the left menu (only for weapons and anatomy)
	RightImage: image on the right side (for weapons, anatomy, and lore)


To add inventory items to UI (in the game)
- drag the Item Pickup prefab into the scene (change the mesh or collider if you want)
- drag the scriptable object for the menu item you want to add into the Item option of the Item Pickup script in the inspector
