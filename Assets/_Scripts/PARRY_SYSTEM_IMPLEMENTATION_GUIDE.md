# Enhanced Parry System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This enhanced parry system uses **animation events** to create precise, frame-specific timing windows that focus on **extended stun duration** for crowd control, working cohesively with your existing grapple system.

## Key Philosophy: Stun-Focused Design
- **Primary Reward**: Extended stun duration (perfect parries = 4 seconds!)
- **Secondary Reward**: Minor damage reduction (parries deal less damage than normal attacks)
- **Cohesive Design**: Stunned enemies work perfectly with your grapple system
- **Simple Knockback**: Consistent, moderate knockback for all parries

## Parry Rewards Breakdown

### Damage Values (Simplified):
- **Normal Attack**: 1.0x base damage
- **Normal Parry**: 0.8x base damage (20% less - parrying isn't about damage!)
- **Perfect Parry**: 0.8x * 1.2x = 0.96x base damage (still less than normal)
- **Perfect Combo Parry**: 0.8x * 1.2x * 1.1x = 1.06x base damage (barely more than normal)

### Stun Duration (The Main Reward):
- **Normal Parry**: 2.0 seconds stun
- **Perfect Parry**: 4.0 seconds stun (2x multiplier!)
- **Combo Parry**: +0.5 seconds bonus stun
- **Perfect Combo Parry**: 4.5 seconds stun (maximum crowd control!)

### Knockback (Simple & Consistent):
- **All Parries**: (30, 15, 30) force - moderate, consistent knockback
- **No Complexity**: Same knockback regardless of parry type
- **Purpose**: Brief repositioning, not launching enemies

## Strategic Benefits

### Why Stun Duration Matters:
1. **Grapple Synergy**: Stunned enemies can be grappled and repositioned
2. **Crowd Control**: 4-second stuns give breathing room in multi-enemy fights  
3. **Tactical Positioning**: Use stuns to separate dangerous enemies
4. **Combo Setup**: Stunned enemies are sitting ducks for follow-up combos

### Perfect Parry Strategy:
```
Normal Parry (2s stun):
- Quick crowd control
- Brief repositioning opportunity
- Standard defensive option

Perfect Parry (4s stun):
- Major crowd control advantage
- Time to grapple and reposition enemy
- Breathing room to handle other threats
- Setup for devastating follow-up attacks
```

## Integration with Grapple System

### How It Works Together:
1. **Perfect Parry Enemy** → 4-second stun
2. **Grapple Stunned Enemy** → Full control over positioning
3. **Reposition Enemy** → Pull them away from allies or into hazards
4. **Release Grapple** → Enemy gets additional `postReleaseStunDuration` 
5. **Total Control Time** → ~5+ seconds of enemy neutralization

### Grapple-Enhanced Tactics:
- **Parry → Grapple → Isolate**: Pull dangerous enemies away from groups
- **Parry → Grapple → Reposition**: Move enemies into better positions for combos
- **Parry → Grapple → Environmental**: Pull enemies into hazards or off ledges
